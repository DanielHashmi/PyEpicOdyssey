## All You Need To Know About Prompt Engineering

### 1. **Be precise and explicit**

Don’t assume hidden meaning. You must spell out every detail: format, tone, constraints.

### 2. **Structure your prompts carefully**

* Start with **clear roles**:
  `"You are a Technical Writing Assistant…"`
* Define objective, format, and negative constraints explicitly:
  *“List 3 best-performing Q1 2025 products, then give 5 strategic bullets, don’t use paragraphs.”.

### 3. **Use agentic workflows**

Turn your LLM into an autonomous agent:

* Remind it it's a **multi‑message agent** (“don’t stop until fully solved”).
* Encourage **planning + reflection** between tool/API calls.
* Insist on **tool‑calls**, not guesses

### 4. **Utilize context adeptly**

* Feed long inputs and place essential prompts at beginning *and* end.
* Remind it of its role mid‑doc to maintain context.

### 5. **Guide reasoning with chain-of-thought**

Despite not being a pure reasoning model, LLMs performs better when asked to "think step‑by‑step." Phrasing like “First X, then Y” yields better accuracy on logical tasks.

### 6. **Few-shot / examples**

Show desired output patterns. Including examples, that helps ensure structure, tone, and format are followed.

### 7. **Iterate empirically**

Treat prompt tuning like debugging:

1. Try basic version
2. Evaluate
3. Adjust one element
4. Repeat Empirical tweaks are key.

## Sample Prompt Template

```md
You are a data extractor.
Extract the following fields:
- Title
- Author
- Date
- Summary

Output in JSON.
[TEXT]
```
```md
You are a math tutor.
Solve the problem step by step and explain your reasoning.
Problem: [PROBLEM]
```

## Types of Prompting

### ✦ Zero-shot

### ✦ Few-shot

### ✦ Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

### ✦ ReAct Prompting 

### ✦ Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

## LLM Tuning
✅ Use temperature:

#### 0 for deterministic answers

#### >0.7 for creativity


## ReAct Prompting Example
```md
You are an intelligent agent that reasons step by step and uses tools.

Question: What is 23 * 47?

Thought: I should calculate step by step.
Action: Multiply(23, 47)

Observation: 1081

Answer: 1081
```
## Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Example
```md
You are solving: How to reduce energy consumption in a data center by 30% in 6 months.

Generate 3 different high-level strategies.
For each, list pros and cons.
Then pick the most promising one to elaborate.

Strategies:
1. Migrate to cloud.
2. Optimize cooling.
3. Use renewable energy.

✅ **Role Prompting**:

> *"You are a senior full-stack developer and technical architect..."*

✅ **Zero-shot instructions**:

> Clear goals for each part of the system.

✅ **Few-shot examples**:

> Provide a sample output example.

✅ **Chain-of-Thought**:

> *"Explain your reasoning step by step."*

✅ **ReAct**:

> *"Thought → Action → Observation."*

✅ **Tree of Thoughts**:

> *"Generate multiple alternatives and evaluate them."*

✅ **Constraints**:

> Next.js 15, Tailwind.

✅ **Format Control**:

> Markdown and code blocks.

✅ **Proactive Edge-Case Handling**:

> *"Highlight edge cases, scalability concerns, and performance optimizations."*


## Summery
🔹 Clarity: Be precise and explicit. Vague prompts = vague answers.

🔹 Context: Give the model everything it needs to know: background, tone, examples.

🔹 Constraints: Specify format, length, style, and detail level.

🔹 Examples: Provide examples if you want structure or style imitation.

🔹 Iteration: Tweak, test, and compare variations.
