### ⚠️ OpenAI Agents SDK Is Wasting Your Resources  Here's Why

If you're using the `stop_on_first_tool` behavior in the OpenAI Agents SDK *with* parallel tool calls enabled... there's a silent inefficiency you need to know.

Let me break it down:

---

### 🔍 What Actually Happens Under the Hood

When you do this:

```python
model_settings = ModelSettings(
    tool_choice="auto",
    parallel_tool_calls=True,
),
tool_use_behavior="stop_on_first_tool"
```

And the LLM selects multiple tools like:

```python
tool_calls = [test_tool_one, test_tool_two]
```

Here’s what the agent **actually does**:

1. The LLM chooses both tools in a single step
2. The SDK uses `asyncio.gather()` to run *all tool calls in parallel*
3. All tools execute to completion even if `test_tool_two` is expensive or unnecessary
4. Then it simply **discards every result except `tool_results[0]`**
5. Your system *never even uses* the output of the other tools

---

### 🗑️ That Means: Tool Results Are Wasted

* ⛽ API tokens spent for unused calls
* 🕒 Time lost on long-running or blocking tools
* ⚠️ Side effects triggered even when their results are thrown away
* 💸 You're billed, they’re ignored

If you're calling external APIs or hitting databases, this can get *really* expensive.

---

### ❓ Why Does This Happen?

It’s a **design trade-off**.

The current SDK chooses **determinism over efficiency**. It guarantees predictable behavior by always using `tool_results[0]`, regardless of execution order or timing.

> But it does *not* cancel remaining tasks once the first completes.
> It does *not* use `asyncio.wait(..., return_when=FIRST_COMPLETED)`.

This means: **you pay for all tools, use only one.**

---

### ✅ What Should You Do?

If you're using `stop_on_first_tool`, do **one** of the following:

1. **Only register one tool** per step don't give it choices
2. **Avoid `parallel_tool_calls=True`** with `stop_on_first_tool` behavior
3. **Write a custom async executor** that uses `FIRST_COMPLETED` and cancels the rest

---

### ⚙️ What's Missing in the SDK?

The SDK **should ideally support**:

* Efficient first-response wins behavior
* Tool cancellation on-the-fly
* Configurable execution modes for budget-conscious agents

---

🔁 Until then, it’s up to us to optimize tool usage manually.

💬 If you’re building agents with expensive tools, keep this in mind or you might be burning tokens and time for nothing.
