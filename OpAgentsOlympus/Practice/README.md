# At T=0: processor starts, _next_export_time = T+5.0 = 5.0  
# At T=3.2: queue has 5000 spans (below 5734 threshold)  
# At T=4.7: queue reaches 5734 spans  
# At T=4.7: Background thread detects queue_size >= 5734, calls _export_batches(force=False)  
# At T=4.7: _next_export_time gets reset to time.time() + 5.0 = ~9.7  
# At T=5.0: Time-based trigger would NOT fire because _next_export_time was reset to ~9.7

Question: Given the BatchTraceProcessor's dual trigger system, what is the state of both export mechanisms immediately after the queue-based export completes its first batch at T=4.7, and how does this affect the pending time-based export that was scheduled to fire at T=5.0?

A) The queue-based export continues processing remaining batches without resetting timers until the queue drops below threshold, while the time-based export fires independently at T=5.0, potentially causing concurrent export operations.

B) Both export timers reset immediately when the queue-based trigger fires at T=4.7, setting the next time-based export to T=9.7 (4.7 + 5.0), and the queue-based mechanism continues processing batches until the queue is empty, regardless of the 5734-span threshold.

C) When the queue-based trigger fires at T=4.7 (5734 spans â‰¥ 5734 threshold), the processor immediately exports one batch of up to 128 spans and resets the next scheduled export time to T=9.7 (4.7 + 5.0). The remaining 5606 spans stay in the queue, and the processor continues its normal dual-trigger monitoring without any special "drain until complete" behavior.

D) The export operation processes all queued spans in sequential batches until complete, then both timers reset with the next time-based export scheduled for T=9.7, ensuring no duplicate exports occur and the queue is fully drained.

Correct Answer: D
