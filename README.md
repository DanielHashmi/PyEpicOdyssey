# 🧠 PyEpicOdyssey - Python Internals & Advanced Concepts

> A deep dive into Python's internals, advanced mechanics, and how things work under the hood. No basic tutorials — just solid, technical understanding.

## 📌 What This Repo Is

This repo is focused on **exploring Python beyond the basics**.  
From how CPython executes your code to how memory is handled, it’s all here.  
If you want to understand Python better, this is for you.

## 🧩 What You’ll Learn

- 🔬 **CPython Internals**  
  Bytecode, Python Virtual Machine, memory management, reference counting, garbage collection.

- ⚙️ **Python Data Model**  
  Dunder methods (`__init__`, `__repr__`, etc.), metaclasses, method resolution order (MRO), descriptors.

- 🧵 **Async, Threads, and Processes**  
  Differences between threading, multiprocessing, and asyncio. Clear explanation of the GIL.

- 🧠 **Closures, Decorators, Context Managers**  
  How Python handles scopes, how decorators work behind the scenes, and what context managers actually do.

- 🔄 **Iterators & Generators**  
  How `for` loops work internally, what `yield` does, generator state, and how lazy evaluation is done.

- 📚 **Memory & Performance**  
  Using `__slots__`, memory optimization, interning, and profiling techniques.

- 🧪 **Edge Cases in Python**  
  Examples that seem strange at first but make sense once you understand how Python actually works.
