# 🧠 PyEpicOdyssey: Python Internals & Agentic AI – Advanced Insights

> Dive deep into Python’s internals, advanced mechanics, and the nuts & bolts of modern agent frameworks.

---

## 🚀 What This Repo Is

Go beyond surface — see exactly how things tick, break, and can be re-engineered.  
If you want to truly understand Python (and the new OpenAI Agents SDK), you’re in the right place.

## 🧩 What You’ll Find Inside

### 🏛️ **Python Deep Dives**
- **CPython Internals:** Bytecode, VM, memory management, reference counting, garbage collection.
- **Data Model Magic:** Dunder methods, MRO, metaclasses, descriptors, and why they matter.
- **Async, Threads & GIL:** Threading, multiprocessing, asyncio, and what’s really possible in Python concurrency.
- **Iterators & Generators:** How `for` works, lazy evaluation, `yield` mechanics.
- **Memory & Performance:** Using `__slots__`, memory optimizations, profiling, and weird edge cases.

### 🤖 **Agentic AI & OpenAI Agents SDK**
- **Agent Loop Internals:**  
  Step-by-step breakdowns of what happens in an agent run ([See: OpAgentLoop.md](docs/OpAgentsOlympus/OpAgentLoop.md))
- **Hooks & Execution Order:**  
  Understand how AgentHooks and RunHooks interact, with MCQs and real trace outputs ([See: OpAgentsComplexMCQ.md](docs/OpAgentsOlympus/OpAgentsComplexMCQ.md))
- **Tool Call Logic & Inefficiencies:**  
  Discover silent SDK inefficiencies: parallel tool calls, wasted resources, and how to optimize ([See: OpAgentsEfficiencyBug.md](docs/OpAgentsOlympus/OpAgentsEfficiencyBug.md))
- **Input Filtering & Handoffs:**  
  The real precedence of input filters during agent handoffs ([See: OpAgentsFilteringPrecedence.md](docs/OpAgentsOlympus/OpAgentsFilteringPrecedence.md))
- **Local LLM Streaming:**  
  How to hook up and stream from a local Jan LLM with the OpenAI-compatible API ([See: OpAgentsLocalLLMStreamed.py](docs/OpAgentsOlympus/OpAgentsLocalLLMStreamed.py))
- **Sync vs Async Agent Runs:**  
  What blocks, what doesn’t, and how to work around limitations ([See: OpAgentsDiff_run_sync_and_run.py](docs/OpAgentsOlympus/OpAgentsDiff_run_sync_and_run.py))
- **Tool Use Behaviors & Custom Logic:**  
  How custom tool use behaviors work and when your decision function is called ([See: OpAgentsOrderOfTools&CustomToolUseBehavior.md](docs/OpAgentsOlympus/OpAgentsOrderOfTools%26CustomToolUseBehavior.md))
- There is a lot more you can dig & explore...

### 🧪 **Live Code Experiments**
- Not just theory.
- MCQs and “weird cases” to challenge your intuition and solidify real-world understanding.
