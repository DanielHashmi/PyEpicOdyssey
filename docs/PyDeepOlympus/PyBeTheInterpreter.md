## Deliberate Mental Simulation of Code Execution: Be The Python Interpreter!

Your brain becomes the interpreter itself. You don’t just read what `a += 2` means, You mentally execute it. You start questioning every single detail, not just accepting what’s written but breaking it down like the compiler would.

Even for a small line like:

```
a += 2
```

You naturally start asking yourself:

* what if? `a + = 2`
* what if? `a =+ 2`
* what if? `a = + 2`
* what if? `2 += a`
* what if? `2 + = a`
* what if? `2 = + a`
* what if? `2 =+ a`
* why not? `2 + a`
* why not? `a = 2`
* why not? `a + 2`

You’re no longer depending on practice to tell you what’s right or wrong. You mentally simulate syntax, behavior, side effects, and errors just like the Python runtime would. When you see a line of code, you parse it, and predict the output.

If you reach this level, then reading theory becomes as effective as coding practically.

You’re not passively reading anymore you’re actively interpreting.

You don’t need to try it in an editor to be sure. You already know what works, what fails, and why.

That’s when theory stops being theory, It becomes internalized execution logic.

And you stop needing the keyboard to prove yourself right.
