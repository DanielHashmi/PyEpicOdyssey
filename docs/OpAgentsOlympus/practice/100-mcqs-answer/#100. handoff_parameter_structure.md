#### The MCQ was intentionally big with useless scenario but the core question was: Which parameter structure correctly represents the difference between agent-level and run-level hook implementations?

#### Answer: D

## Agent Hooks

```python
async def on_handoff(
    self,
    context: RunContextWrapper[TContext],
    agent: TAgent,
    source: TAgent,
) -> None:
    """Called when the agent is being handed off to. The `source` is the agent that is handing
    off to this agent."""
    pass
```

## Run Hooks

```python
    async def on_handoff(
        self,
        context: RunContextWrapper[TContext],
        from_agent: TAgent,
        to_agent: TAgent,
    ) -> None:
        """Called when a handoff occurs."""
        pass
```

> Note: Source Agent in on_handoff of RunHooks is the third parameter while fourth in AgentHooks.
