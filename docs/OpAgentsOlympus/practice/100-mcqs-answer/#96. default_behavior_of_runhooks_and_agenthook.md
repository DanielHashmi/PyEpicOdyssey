#### Question: What is the fundamental difference in execution behavior between RunHooks and AgentHooks when they are not explicitly configured on an agent?

#### Answer: D

```python
if hooks is None:
    hooks = RunHooks[Any]()
```
---

```python
await asyncio.gather(
    hooks.on_handoff(
        context=context_wrapper,
        from_agent=agent,
        to_agent=new_agent,
    ),
    (
        agent.hooks.on_handoff(
            context_wrapper,
            agent=new_agent,
            source=agent,
        )
        if agent.hooks
        else _coro.noop_coroutine()
    ),
)
```

#### RunHooks are configured by default, AgentHooks are not configured by default.
