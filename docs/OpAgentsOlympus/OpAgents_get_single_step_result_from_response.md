The `_get_single_step_result_from_response` method is a core orchestration function in the `AgentRunner` class that processes a model response and determines what should happen next in the agent workflow

## Purpose and Functionality

This method serves as the bridge between receiving a model response and executing the appropriate actions based on that response. It takes a raw `ModelResponse` and converts it into a structured `SingleStepResult` that contains all the information needed to continue the agent execution loop

The method performs two key operations:

1. **Response Processing**: It calls `RunImpl.process_model_response()` to parse the model's output into structured actions like tool calls, handoffs, and computer actions

2. **Tool Use Tracking and Execution**: It updates the `AgentToolUseTracker` with tools used, then executes `RunImpl.execute_tools_and_side_effects()` to run any tools that were called and determine the next step in the workflow

## Usage in the Execution Flow

The method is called in two critical places in the agent execution system:

### Non-Streaming Execution
In the standard execution path, it's called after getting a new response from the model in `_run_single_turn()`

### Streaming Execution  
In streaming mode, it's called after the streaming response is complete to process the final result in `_run_single_turn_streamed()`

## Return Value and Decision Making

The method returns a `SingleStepResult` that contains a `next_step` field indicating what should happen next, The execution loop then uses this to decide whether to:

- **Continue the loop** (`NextStepRunAgain`) - when tools were executed but no final output was determined
- **Hand off to another agent** (`NextStepHandoff`) - when a handoff tool was called
- **Terminate with final output** (`NextStepFinalOutput`) - when the agent produces structured output or completes without more tools to run

## Method Signature and Parameters

The method accepts comprehensive parameters including the agent, all available tools, original input, pre-step items, the new response, output schema, handoffs, hooks, context wrapper, run config, and tool use tracker

## Notes

This method is essential to the turn-based execution model **where each "turn" represents one model invocation** plus all resulting side effects. It encapsulates the complex logic of determining what actions to take based on the model's response and ensures the agent workflow continues appropriately. The method also handles tool use tracking to support features like automatic tool choice reset to prevent infinite loops.
