âœ¨ Spent some hours putting this together, A mind map for the OpenAI Agents SDK



Itâ€™s basically a cheat sheet / truth table, it just directly tells the truth



There are some points that took me time to understand after reading the official docs and digging into source code, I just added them all in this mind map created with NotebookLM



 ðŸ“Œ I made it because I wanted one clean place that shows everything at a glance
